title: Week Of April 18, 2016
---

This week, I finished Life and started studying for the final.

This upcoming week, I have to keep studying for the upcoming exam, and review all material on the schedule.

Next, I'll have my final Game Tech project in the way, and nothing else.

Learning the virtual method system has been interesting because it's the first time I've seen a C++ feature that's so substantially different from other languages I've used. The complex system of operations involved seemed rather daunting at first, but Life helped me understand it all. I want to make an extension of Life that animates the evolutions in real time. I noticed evolution patterns while working on it that were pretty cool.

Tip of the Week:

Sublime has many extensions to offer, including one that allows you to remotely build your project. It's worth it to modify your text editor to make development as comfortable and versatile as possible.
